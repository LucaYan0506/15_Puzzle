# 15_Puzzle 
I re-did a famous game called 15 puzzle using C#.  

My record is 40 seconds.  
Download the game and try to beat me!

## How to let the AI solve it

2) There are 2 options: Beginner and Advanced AI. Choose one of them and click it.

## Theory behind Beginner AI
The whole algorithm is based on DFS. Using DFS it tries through every possible combination.

To speed up the algorithm, I've decided to "lock" cells when they are in the correct side/position.

## Theory behind Advanced AI
The initial idea was using A-Star algorithm to find the quickest path and solve it in less than 10 seconds. However, due the limitation of the hardware, if I use A-Star it will take ages to find the quickest path. So, I've used DFS for the first part and A-Star for the second part. In order to speed up the first part I've used the same approch for Beginner AI + an reduceMoves algorithm. This algorithm will skip some moves.
